# Purpose

This is an opinionated collection of common sense, practices, thoughts, and writings on working with software-as-a-service architectures
and teams and how to develop, test, review and deploy production ready services.

Areas covered include logging, metrics, review checklists, review areas and a general collection of stuff we didn't think we needed to write
down for people collected in one spt.
